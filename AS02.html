by our faint shadows going before us is an attempt to sustain a <br>
correspondence with and for nobody. it holds hope that in doing <br>
this it can sustain the conditions under which it may be <br>
corresponded to by nobody. this is to say, it holds hope that <br>
we can know the soul.
<br><br>
‘nominations’ of a soul which has, so to speak, become <br>
momentarily aware of itself are chanced upon, anonymous, and <br>
absolute. they carry the Idea of chance. one such nomination is <br>
‘Dorothy Wordsworth’ and her Alfoxden Journal, on which the <br>
text in this booklet is based. another, lodged within <br>
Wordsworth’s book (itself acquired on a whim), is a blank <br>
postcard of ‘Glencoyne Wood’ by the sea in England, which is <br>
pictured in the booklet alongside the text.
<br><br>
nominations are the opposite of monuments. they affirm the <br>
existence of empty points, blank letters, silences. Dorothy <br>
Wordsworth’s silence, in which for me she appeared as the <br>
nomination ‘Dorothy Wordsworth’, began at a particular point <br>
in the text. this was then confirmed by a second point, <br>
instantaneous with the awareness that her entries were now, <br>
as they had already been, saturated with silence. she writes:
<br><br>
<i>‘30th. Walked I know not where.<br>
31st. Walked.<br>
  1st. Walked by moonlight.’ <br> </i>
<br>
The Idea shines through us unseen, <br>
the shadow of the moon guides our steps—<br>
‘by our faint shadows going before us.’<br>
<br><br>
*<br><br>
by our faint shadows going before us is a booklet & music. <br>
the booklet includes photos, text, and the score, as well <br>
as quotations from Dorothy Wordsworth’s Alfoxden Journal (1798).<br>
the music is performed by the quartet Short Americans <br>
(Luke Martin, Noah Ophoven-Baldwin, Max Wanderman, Adam Zahller).
