All Sky 3 is a combined effort from Zhu Wenbo, a self-taught musician <br>
based in Beijing, and Lyn Corelle, a photographer, filmmaker, and <br>
writer living in Minneapolis. Although the booklet and CD isn‚Äôt a <br>
collaboration between the two artists (Zhu reached out to me with his <br>
recordings and I asked Lyn if I could print her photographs) there is <br>
a distinct austerity in both their works that unifies the release. <br>
<br>
Lyn‚Äôs photographs from her project, Single Family homes in 3030?, <br>
captures trash cans, garages, alleyways, trees, and fences in the  <br>
evening light; simple and confounding depictions of life in so-called <br>
Minneapolis. The images, seemingly plain and unadorned, hold an <br>
underlying intimate and omniscient gaze trailing the shadows of each <br>
photograph. <br>
<br>
In Clarinet Solo Recordings Vol. 1 Zhu Wenbo plays clarinet by himself. <br>
There is a particular lack of indulgence in Zhu‚Äôs work. It is clear that <br>
he is doing nothing other than addressing exactly what is happening at <br>
the present moment. An insistence that whatever may be coming later and <br>
has already happened is not factored into our experience now. <br>
<br>
All Sky 3 is a booklet of photography by Lyn Corelle & a CD with music <br>
by Zhu Wenbo. The booklet includes selected photos from Lyn Corelle's <br>
larger project, "Single Family Homes in the Year 3030?". The music is <br>
solo clarinet improvisations from Zhu Wenbo's home. <br>
