0 Oktas is a sort of proof of concept for this new label, All Sky, a place for words, images, sounds, you, me and all of us. A place to allow it all‚Äîsky, earth, dirt, space and time, to be here and there all at once.

  A summer night is magic
<br>Enthralling me so
<br>The night would be tragic
<br>If you weren't here to share it, my dear
<br>Covered with heaven above

The writing reflects a concern for what is here and what is to come or never happen again. Clouds, or no clouds at all, a beautiful day, a moment watching the birds in the trees, the sun in my eyes or nothing at all is precisely what it is and, as we walk and wait longer and longer, may or may not be here tomorrow.

Not even the lightest breeze ruffled the tranquil waters on which my little barque sailed; no cloud darkened the blue sky. I felt fully recompensed for all I had gone through, and I kept saying: "Now I am here forever."

The music is an insistent tribute to everything else that ever was and could have been in place of what is offered here. Ideally there would be something else and unfortunately it‚Äôs not quite discernible here. Something else that is less‚Äî but also a decent alternative, ‚Äúthe best foot forward‚Äù to what ideally we should have been doing and undoing.
