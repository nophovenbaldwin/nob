by our faint shadows going before us is an attempt to sustain a correspondence with and for nobody. it holds hope that in doing this it can sustain the conditions under which it may be corresponded to by nobody. this is to say, it holds hope that we can know the soul.
 
‘nominations’ of a soul which has, so to speak, become momentarily aware of itself are chanced upon, anonymous, and absolute. they carry the Idea of chance. one such nomination is ‘Dorothy Wordsworth’ and her Alfoxden Journal, on which the text in this booklet is based. another, lodged within Wordsworth’s book (itself acquired on a whim), is a blank postcard of ‘Glencoyne Wood’ by the sea in England, which is pictured in the booklet alongside the text.
 
nominations are the opposite of monuments. they affirm the existence of empty points, blank letters, silences. Dorothy Wordsworth’s silence, in which for me she appeared as the nomination ‘Dorothy Wordsworth’, began at a particular point in the text. this was then confirmed by a second point, instantaneous with the awareness that her entries were now, as they had already been, saturated with silence. she writes:
 
‘30th. Walked I know not where.
31st. Walked.
1st. Walked by moonlight.’
 
The Idea shines through us unseen, the shadow of the moon guides our steps—
‘by our faint shadows going before us.’
