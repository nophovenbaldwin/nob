Music for —every—one on the Monday nights of April at the Icehouse, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
curated by Noah Ophoven-Baldwin
“At about 15 c/s the labyrinth gives away to skin as the chief organ of vibratory sensibility for the human body. In ‘hearing,’ or receiving sound, knowing, remembering, and recognizing it, and amnesia, probably genetic, seems to let ear predominate. Tone-of-place, ‘experienced,’ ‘heard,’ through skin, detected by unnamed sensibilities, an impression carried in through skin even when not in the physical place—having been there a long time—continues—is carried in self. Tone around you and with you. “I don’t like your tone.” “I like your tone.” “I like the tone of this place.” -Maryanne Amacher
