0 Oktas is a sort of proof of concept for this new label, All Sky, a place for <br>
words, images, sounds, you, me and all of us. A place to allow it all‚Äî<br>
sky, earth, dirt, space and time, to be here and there all at once.

  A summer night is magic
<br>Enthralling me so
<br>The night would be tragic
<br>If you weren't here to share it, my dear
<br>Covered with heaven above
  </i>
<br><br>
The writing reflects a concern for what is here and what is to come <br>
or never happen again. Clouds, or no clouds at all, a beautiful day, <br>
a moment watching the birds in the trees, the sun in my eyes or <br>
nothing at all is precisely what it is and, as we walk and wait <br>
longer and longer, may or may not be here tomorrow.
<br><br>

<i>Not even the lightest breeze ruffled the <br>
tranquil waters on which my little barque <br>
sailed; no cloud darkened the blue sky. I <br>
felt fully recompensed for all I had gone <br>
through, and I kept saying: "Now I am here <br>
forever."

The music is an insistent tribute to everything else that ever was <br>
and could have been in place of what is offered here. Ideally there <br>
would be something else and unfortunately it‚Äôs not quite discernible.<br>
This is something else that is less‚Äî but also a decent alternative, <br>
‚Äúthe best foot forward‚Äù to what ideally we should have been doing <br>
and undoing.
