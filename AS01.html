0 Oktas is a sort of proof of concept for this new label, All Sky, <br>
a place for words, images, sounds, you, me and all of us. A place <br>
to allow it all‚Äîsky, earth, dirt, space and time, to be here and <br>
there all at once.

A summer night is magic
<br>Enthralling me so
<br>The night would be tragic
<br>If you weren't here to share it, my dear
  <br>Covered with heaven above <a href="#f1">[1]</a>

The writing reflects a concern for what is here and what is to <br>
come or never happen again. Clouds, or no clouds at all, a <br>
beautiful day, a moment watching the birds flicker through the <br>
trees, the sun in our eyes or nothing at all is precisely what <br>
it is and, as we walk and wait longer and longer, may or may not <br>
be here tomorrow.

<p class="tab"><i>
Not even the lightest breeze ruffled the <br>
tranquil waters on which my little barque <br>
sailed; no cloud darkened the blue sky. I <br>
felt fully recompensed for all I had gone <br>
through, and I kept saying: "Now I am here <br>
  forever." <a href="#f2">[2]</a>
  </i></p>
The music is an insistent tribute to everything else that ever <br> 
was and could have been in place of what is offered here. Ideally <br>
there would be something else and unfortunately it‚Äôs not quite <br>
discernible. This is something else that is less‚Äîbut also a <br>
decent alternative, ‚Äúthe best foot forward‚Äù to what, ideally, we <br>
should have been doing and undoing all along.
