  0 Oktas is a sort of proof of concept for this new label, All Sky, a place for words, images, sounds, you, me and all of us. A place to allow it all‚Äîsky, earth, dirt, space and time, to be here and there all at once.

A summer night is magic
Enthralling me so
The night would be tragic
If you weren't here to share it, my dear
Covered with heaven above

The writing in 0 Oktas reflects a concern for what is here and what is to come or never happen again. Clouds, or no clouds at all, a beautiful day, a moment watching the birds in the trees or nothing at all is precisely what it is and, as we walk and wait longer and longer, may or may not be here tomorrow.

The music is in response to the work of Th√©r√®se of Lisieux. How can I be small with the greatest love? 

Not even the lightest breeze ruffled the tranquil waters on which my little barque sailed; no cloud darkened the blue sky. I felt fully recompensed for all I had gone through, and I kept saying: "Now I am here forever." 

0 Oktas is a collection of live performances, field recordings and compositions accompanied by an essay about clouds and other things.
